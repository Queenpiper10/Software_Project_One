The user is supposed to enter the indicated information into the text 
boxes for whatever fucntion the user wants to perform. Once the information is entered the
user should press the button bellow for that section. To see the change in the table (for update, 
delete and create tweet) the user should press the get table 
button after pressing the button for the function they want to perform. This is to make
the table with the changes generate. For the get tweet info a seperate table should show up below the  
get tweet button with the user's tweet information. Sadly I was not able to get the update method or get user tweet
information working correctly. However, the rest of the methods should work. 

NOTE: IN the creat a tweet method, the user has to enter a username along with a user ID and tweet.
